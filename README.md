> Do you find yourself asking friends and family what tv show or movie you should watch for the evening? Well this is why I chose to build loungezilla. This application allows you to browse tv shows and movies based on popularity and genre. You can make an account and start adding to your collections of stuff that intrests you. Watch a trailer of something if you are unsure what its about. Your friends and family can also add to the collections page and then everyone can see what eachother has added. In the future I plan to implement collections for individal users, allow users to see other users collections, like or dislike a certain users collection and an actual watching feature just like Netflix. Thanks for checking out my project and play around with it at the homepage!
